                    <p class="mt-md-4 mt-3"> ASD is usually first diagnosed in childhood with many of 
                        the most-obvious signs presenting around 2-3 years old, but some children with autism 
                        develop normally until toddlerhood when they stop acquiring or lose previously gained skills 
                        Autism spectrum disorder is also three to four times more common in boys than in girls, 
                        and many girls with ASD exhibit less obvious signs compared to boys. Autism is a lifelong condition. 
                        However, many children diagnosed with ASD go on to live independent, productive, and fulfilling lives. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="mt-3"> Autism differs from person to person in severity and combinations of symptoms. 
                        There is a great range of abilities and characteristics of children with autism spectrum 
                        disorder — no two children appear or behave the same way. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and often change over time.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mt-3">  We love working with our kiddies on the spectrum, they bring so much joy into all of our lives! 
                        Autism spectrum disorder is a spectrum for a reason. No two children present in the same manner, however, all children 
                        on the spectrum have difficulties in three particular areas, those being, social skills, communication and repetitive 
                        or restrictive behaviors. Children on the spectrum have unique sensory profiles and needs, each child reacting 
                        differently to incoming sensory stimuli. As sensory integration therapists, our assessment looks at how a child 
                        responds to various sensory input, be it a hypo-response or a hyper-response. We use this information as the basis 
                        of our therapy, working towards an improved adaptive response which will assist them to cope with the demands of 
                        their daily activities.
