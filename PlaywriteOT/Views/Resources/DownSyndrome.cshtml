                        Down syndrome is a genetic condition that causes mild to serious physical and developmental problems.
                        People with Down syndrome are born with an extra chromosome. Chromosomes are bundles of genes, and your 
                        body relies on having just the right number of them. With Down syndrome, this extra chromosome leads to a 
                        range of issues that affect you both mentally and physically.

                        Doctors know more about down syndrome now more than ever before.
                        If your child has it, getting the right care early on can make a big difference in helping them live a full
                        and meaningful life.
