                        A learning difficulty (also referred to as a learning disability) can be described as an issue with the brain's 
                        ability to process information. Individuals who have a learning difficulty may not learn in the same way or as quickly 
                        as their peers, and they might find certain aspects of learning, such as the development of basic skills, to be challenging.

                    <p class="mt-3">
                        Learning difficulties' effects may impact an individual's performance throughout life, academically, in the workplace, and daily life. 
                        Intervention and support, which may be supplemented by counseling, 
                        can help an individual with a learning difficulty to achieve success.
